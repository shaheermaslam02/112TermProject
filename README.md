# 112TermProject

## Guitar Tab Generator

I attempt to create a Guitar Tab Generator, which creates a guitar tab (a form of “sheet music” for guitar) based on microphone input. The purpose of this is to eliminate the need to manually create guitar tabs by hand, where instead guitar can be played into the microphone to generate one. By processing audio from the microphone in real time, one can record their audio and visualize the notes they are playing. There is also a simple guitar tuner included.

### How To Use

The file to run the program is Main.py. All other files within the repository should be included within the same folder when running this code so that images and other processing files can be used in the Main.py file. 

### Libraries

The libraries included in this project are as follows:

* cmu_112_graphics
* tkinter
* sounddevice
* scipy
* aubio
* pyaudio
* numpy
* pandas
* requests

### Directions

Directions are provided from screen to screen as you move through the program.
